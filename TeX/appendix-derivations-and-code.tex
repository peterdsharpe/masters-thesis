\section{Constrained Rosenbrock Problem}
\label{sect:rosen-derivation}
Here, we derive a closed-form solution to the constrained Rosenbrock problem, restated from Eq. \ref{eq:constrained-rosenbrock} as:

\begin{mini}
    |l|
        {x, y}{(1-x)^2 + 100 (y - x^2)^2}
        {}{}
    \addConstraint{x^2 + y^2 \leq 1}
\end{mini}

The objective function, which we denote $f(x, y)$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:unconstrained-rosen}; the constraint limits the feasible region to the unit ball.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \ifdraft{}{\input{figures/rosen.pgf}}
    \caption{Rosenbrock Function}
    \label{fig:unconstrained-rosen}
\end{figure}


We find the gradient of $f$ to be:

\begin{equation}
    \nabla f =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \diff{f}{x} \\
        \diff{f}{y}
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        400x(x^2 - y) + 2x - 2 \\
        -200x^2 + 200y
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Ignoring the constraint to begin, we find the unconstrained critical points by setting $\nabla f = \vec{0}$. Thus, the $\diff{f}{y}=0$ condition yields $x^2 = y$, which is substituted into the remaining equation to yield:

\begin{equation}
    400x(y-y)+2x-2 = 0 \implies 2x-2 = 0 \implies x=1
\end{equation}

Given $x=1$, the $\diff{f}{y}=0$ conditions implies $y=1$. Thus, $(x, y) = (1, 1)$ is the only critical point of the unconstrained problem.\footnote{Further analysis or graphical inspection reveals this to be the global minimum of the unconstrained problem.}

Thus, the only critical point for the unconstrained problem lies outside the feasible region. The complementary slackness optimality condition implies that criticality ($\nabla f = 0$ locally) is a requirement for optimality in the absence of an active constraint. Thus, we infer that the constrained optimum must lie on the constraint boundary and that the constraint have a nonzero associated dual variable.

We now prepare to formulate and directly solve optimality conditions including the constraint using the KKT conditions. We first rewrite the constraint in the form $g(x) \leq 0$, where here, $g(x) = x^2+y^2-1$. The constraint gradient is then:

\begin{equation}
    \nabla g =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        2x \\
        2y
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Now, the optimality conditions can be formed. For the unknowns $x, y, \lambda$, we obtain a set of two equations from the stationarity requirement of the Lagrangian:

\begin{equation}
    \nabla f + \lambda \nabla g(x) = \vec{0}
\end{equation}

A third equation comes from the constraint itself, which we now know to be tight:

\begin{equation}
    g(x) = 0
\end{equation}

Together:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        400x(x^2-y)+2x-2+2\lambda x &= 0 \\
        -200x^2 + 200y + 2\lambda y &= 0 \\
        x^2 + y^2 - 1 &= 0 \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This system of three equations does not readily admit an analytic solution, but a numerical solution can be easily obtained:

\begin{equation}
    x = 0.7864, y = 0.6177, \lambda = 0.1215
    \label{eq:constrained-rosen-solution}
\end{equation}

Finally, we can illustrate the poor scaling in this problem by evaluating the condition number of the Hessian at the optimum. The Hessian matrix of the objective function is found to be:

\begin{equation}
    \mat{H} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \ddiff{f}{x} & \ddiffm{f}{x}{y} \\
        \ddiffm{f}{x}{y} & \ddiff{f}{y}
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1200x^2 - 400y + 2 & -400x \\
        -400x & 200
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Which, evaluated at the optimum of $(x, y) = (0.7864, 0.6177)$ yields:

\begin{equation}
    \mat{H} \approx
    \begin{bmatrix}
        497 & -315 \\
        -315 & 200
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

After eigenvalue factorization, we evaluate the condition number to find:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{cond}(\mat{H}) \approx 1054
\end{equation}

\section{Discontinuities at Non-Optimal Points}
\label{sect:discontinuities-at-non-optimal}

Continuing from Section \ref{sect:differentiability}, we note that discontinuity and non-differentiability is still admissible if it does not occur at the optimum. For example, we can pose the following problem, which has countably infinite non-continuous, non-differentiable points:

\begin{mini}
    |l|
        {x}{x \cdot \left\lfloor x + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \frac{1}{10} x^2}
        {}{}
    \label{eq:nondiff}
\end{mini}

\noindent
where the objective function and its derivative are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:nondiff}. This problem is easily solved as-written in AeroSandbox, because the region surrounding the optimum ($x=0$, $f(x)=0$) is locally $C_1$-continuous. Convergence is easily achieved even if the initial guess is one of these discontinuous points: with an initial guess of $x_0=10.5$, solution is achieved in just 6 iterations.
