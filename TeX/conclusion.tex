\chapter{Conclusions}

In closing, we summarize contributions made and outline a plethora of potential avenues for future research built upon principles established here.

\section{Summary of Contributions}

This thesis has demonstrated the advantages of a unified, end-to-end automatic-differentiable framework for engineering design optimization, with specific applications to aircraft design. After identifying the key components of such a framework, we implement such a framework in the form of an open-source Python library called \textit{AeroSandbox}.
