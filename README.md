Title: **AeroSandbox: A Differentiable Framework for Aircraft Design Optimization**

Abstract: This work presents a new computational framework for conceptual aircraft design
called AeroSandbox. This framework leverages modern techniques for automatic
differentiation developed in the optimal control and machine learning communities.
By combining these efficient gradient calculations with robust optimizers such
as IPOPT, multidisciplinary aircraft design problems of practical interest can be
solved in seconds. We demonstrate this speed with several canonical aircraft design
problems in this work, showing that performance and flexibility equals or exceeds
that of state-of-the-art tools in many cases.
This framework’s modular approach to engineering analysis allows sophisticated
aerospace problems to be constructed by connecting plug-and-play building blocks
in code. This decreases the time required to go from a qualitative vehicle and mission
concept to a quantitative, optimized performance estimate. The framework’s em-
phasis on rapid development time and run time enables an engineer to interactively
pose design questions, enabling human insight to be more readily applied to the
computational design process.
