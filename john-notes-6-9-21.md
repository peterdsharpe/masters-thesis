# Thesis Notes from John

* Almost a PhD thesis
	* Strategy question: do you want to cut everything
	* Hold stuff for PhD?
	* What's the right way to do it?
		* Possibility: Master's is the general framework; not gonna worry about applications. PhD is applications. (Easiest)
			* Counter: people tend to thing of methodological things as more original than analysis
				* Using ASB as different cases; more fundamental contribution is the insight you get
		* Other: Repackage the Master's inside the PhD
		* One thing: is there a place to cut the ASB framework; and then add more to PhD
* Potentially: truncate a little bit; keep functional
	* Truncate 
* Editorial parts:
	* 1.1: Say you're really focused on optimization aircraft design. 
		* Start with aircraft design; *then* say that this is also more general
	* 1.2
		* Raymer quote: cut some of it; a lot of people don't like Raymer
	* 1.3
		* Examples of time-dependency are too subtle. Maybe keep just one or two examples; then go through them more clearly
			* Boeing example
	* Style point:
		* Tendency to amplify in language:
			* Page 21; cut the "unquestionably"
		* Could you defend your statements
	* Explain OML parameterization; give some examples.
	* 3.2.1
		* Cut "easy"
	* Figure 4.2: make rosenbrock picture more view-able
	* 4.5: rewrite the little blurb
* Cut the applications; maybe even cut the discipline-specific models
